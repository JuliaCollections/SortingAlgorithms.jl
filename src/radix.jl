#TODO clear thourough comment description
#TODO alternate counts as well as ps/ts
#TODO migrate regression testing target from old_radix_sort to radix_sort
#TODO deal with the fact that old_radix_sort is faster than radix_sort. Possibly use both?
# possibly drop floating point support?
# *Default arguments & comipler optimization with constants?
# *Use slower & leave a note that there is a faster availible for later performance optimizations.
# its only abt 5%
